# MonsterHuntAssist
An Unreal Tournament mutator with several functions to assist with the MonsterHunt gameplay

Proposed functionalities:
* A `mutate help` command which lists all available functions.
* A `mutate supersupershockrifle` command which spawns a SuperShockRifle with 100000 hitdamage.
* A `mutate teleportto <playername>` command.
* A mutate command which spawns a warshell and lets the spawner fly around with it.
* A mutate command which makes all SpawnFactories visible and shows the remaining spawn count for each of them.
